<h2>Goku vs Saitama?</h2></font>
<p><font color="Yellow">
<h3>Saitama</h3>
    <h2><ol><b>Constantly getting stronger while fighting someone at the same level as him</b></ol></h2>
    <h2><ol><b>Even while fighting someone who copies his at it's strongest, his power continues to grow above that</b></ol></h2>
    <h2><ol><b>Saitama was fighting someone with the power of a god and was winning</b></ol></h2>
    <h2><ol><b>Was able to sneeze away the gas surrounding the core of Jupiter</b></ol></h2></font>

<h3>Goku</h3>
    <h2><ol><br>Able to multiply his power by 10x with one of his transformations</br></ol></h2>
    <h2><ol><br>Has a form that can dodge almost anything called Ultra Instinct or UI</br></ol></h2>

    <h2><ol><br>Gets stronger when he is in a life or death situation</br></ol></h2>
    <h2><ol><br>Has the power of a god of destruction in his universe</ol></h2></font>
<font color="Red">
<h3>I would personally say Saitama is stronger being dubbed One Punch Man in his universe but this is just an opinion</h2></font>
